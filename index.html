        <h2>Freshman Film Major in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a freshman at Bob Jones University studying Film and Digital Storytelling.
             I have a passion for all the arts including painting, sculptures, writing, theater, music, film, musicals in general, etc.</p>
         <p>
            I hope to direct and write my own films. I've become well-known in my major for being a good actor.
         <p>
            I enjoy watching films, listening to music, watching YouTube, playing video games, and writing.
         </p>
